# websiteInteractveMap
The website is an interactive map which can represent the distribution of 11 socioeconomic variables in the New York City and the histogram of the variables. The variables are in the first pull-down list. In the second pull-down list, I used Principal Component Analysis(a method from machine learning) to deal with all the variables, compressed all the variables into 3 big factors  and represented the 4 big factors in the interactive map, too. In the third pull-down list, there are two study areas, but in this website I only used data for New York City.
